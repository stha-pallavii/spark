    "\n",
    "The SparkContext contains all the information about the way Spark is set up. When running on a cluster, the SparkContext contains the address of the cluster and will make sure operations on RDDs will be executed there. In the cell below, we create a [`SparkContext`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext) using `local mode`. This means that Spark will run locally, not on a cluster. It will offer some form of parallelism by making use of the various cores it has available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that Spark is best used in `cluster mode` where it will run on many machines simultaneously. `Local mode` is only meant for training or testing purposes. However, Spark works quite well in local mode and can be quite powerful. In order to run locally developed code on a cluster, the only thing that needs to be changed is the `SparkContext` and paths to in- and output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when working in `local mode` it is important to think of an RDD as a data structure that is distributed over many machines on a cluster, and is not available locally. The machine that contains the `SparkContext` is called the *driver*. The SparkContext will communicate with the cluster manager to make sure that the operations on RDDs will run on the cluster in the form of *workers*. It is important to realize that the driver is a separate entity from the nodes in the cluster. You can consider the notebook as being the driver."

    "There are two kinds of operations on RDDs: transformations and actions. Transformations take as input an RDD and produce as output another RDD (you cannot change an existing RDD, they are immutable). Computation of transformations is deferred until an *action* is executed. An action does not return an RDD, but instead returns data to the driver (for example in the form of a Python list), or writes data to disk or a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This *laziness* of executing transformations allows Spark to optimize computations. Only when the user wants real output, the framework will start to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most used transformations is [`map`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.map). This is very similar to the `Map` in MapReduce. The Spark version of `Map` is a method called `map` defined on an RDD, and takes as input a single function. This function will be applied to each element in the RDD, and Spark will put the result of the application in the output RDD.\n",
